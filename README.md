Let's think about *learning*, particularly *conceptual learning*. It's something that we, as human beings with human brains, are born doing from day one, but like all of our other natural abilities, if we reflect on the actual machanics of the process, we can start to do it in a more delibrate and efficient way. We might have a subconsious instinct that enables us to run, but no one is going to finish a marathon without reflecting on *how* we run and what we can do to run *better*. Learning is the same way--if we want to go from casuals to marathon-learners, we are going to need to teach ourselves how learning works. We are going to start by outlining exactly what our goals are, i.e. how we know when we're done, before we dive into to looking at some things to consider along the way.

## Stages of Understanding

If you ask someone "how do you know when you've learned something," their going to answer, "when you understand it." Really, though, this just reframes the question: what does it mean to understand something? One specfic gauge of understanding is to think about whether you could participate in a conversation about it: if you were interacting with an expert in that topic could you keep up? could you answer questions? could you contribute actively?

Imagine for a minute that you have been invited to a programming party--where everyone is there to hang out and talk about programing concepts. At the party your going to see a few guests:

1. **Tarzan** is not a great conversationalist. He's just started to learn about coding and hasn't writen anything yet. He is able listen to conversations and get the gist of what they're about, but not pull any specifc knowledge from them. When he looks over the concepts he's able to point at them and grunt out a name here and there: ...variable...array...method...

2. **Dora the Explorer** is also at the party. She's been programming for a little bit, but still lacks a conceptual foundation for a lot of what she does. She usually knows *what* to do, but maybe not *why*. In the conversations at the party she's able to ask and answer factual questions about core programming concepts, but cannot talk about them at length. ...is this a global variable? yes / no... ...is this a class or instance method? class / instance...

3. **The Coder** is hanging out at the party. They've written there own programs and undertand what and why they use certain concepts. They can answer open ended questions about programming concepts and understand why things work the way they do. ...why would you use a class variable here?... ...Let me explain the difference between arr.each and arr.map...

4. **The Expert** is throwing the party. They've written many of there own programs and can talk at length about a wide variety of concepts. At first they may seem a lot like The Coder, but, when they talk about a concept, they can also talk about its connections with other ideas and they can discuss how that topic would play out in unusual situations. ...what if you tried to write following a proceedural paradigm?...

It's important to keep in mind that these guests are going to have trouble talking to each other--but not because of a difference in factual knowledge. Tarzan understands all the *words* the expert uses. He may know what "array" and "list" *mean*, but when he hears, "arrays represent continuous segments of memory and lists can be discontinous," he's going to derrive no meaning from that sentence as a whole--not because he needs to be told *what* any of those things are, but because he still needs to internalize the underlying concepts. At the same time, Tarzan may know a lot of facts and words that the Expert has forgotten. The Expert may not actually be able to rattle off a definition of a bubble sort, but that's just because the concept is so internalized that they don't need the label anymore--its just a second nature thing that he does.

Every one of us is in some ways the Tarzan and in some ways the Expert. We all have ideas that we've heard of but can't define and we all have concepts that are so familiar we can see connections to them everywhere. Even in very similar things, our proficiency level can vary widely, but if we can self assess where we are at, we can then target our learning to get us to the next step in the journey to mastery. If I understand that I'm a Tarzan now, I can set practical and reachable goal for myself. I know that I'm not going to turn into an Expert tomorrow, but I can try to turn into Dora.

These guests also have technical names from ACFL:
1. **Novice**: Can recognize the basic vocabulary of a topic.
2. **Intermediate**: Can answer factual questions about a topic.
3. **Advanced**: Can describe something in a topic.
4. **Superior**: Can contribute to a topc.

## Principles to Learn by

These stages of understanding can give us a picture of what to expect when we encounter a new concept: we will need to spend some period of time just settling into what things are at play before we can start learning to articluate facts about those things. Once we get comfortable *identifying* a concept we can more on to *using* it actively in our code--we can start recognizing the *context* in which that concept is needed. Ultimately, our goal is the ability to understand a concept without needing the terms for it; we want the concept to be fully internalized in our minds so that we can not only use it, but also *manipulate* it to whatever situation we happen to be in. This progression is a natural process that will eventually come with enough practice; however, we can learn to accelerate it by approaching learning experiences in the right way. 

### γνῶθι σεαυτόν (Know yourself)

It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking about learning like you're leveling up in a video game: you grind away with exercises and assignments before eventually you get the upgrade. In real life though, there's a big difference between what your brain does when it completes a task and what it does when it acquires a skill. We have all stayed up all night to finish some project or paper or test. We got it done, but didn't remember anything about it a week later. That's because a tired brain can check boxes, type words, and finish worksheets--it can *do* tasks--but it can't form the long term connections of genuine learning effectively.

If we grind away, if we stay up too late, work to long, or stress too much, learning is going to slow to a halt. We might finish labs, but but we will miss out on our real goal. If you feel yourself getting frusterated, tired, loosing focus, etc., then you *need* to take a break. The longer you try to push through, the longer it will take to bring yourself back to a productive state of mind. We all want to work hard and taking breaks can *feel* like you're being lazy, but it will ultimately lead to you working more *productive* hours in total.

Your brain has real, hard-and-fast, physiological limits to what it can do that we just can't fight against. We have to learn to work *within* these limits, to accept them as a fact of life, and to recognize when we are getting close to burning out. Be self-aware and take short, frequent breaks.

### Close enough is good enough, for now

To add to the limits and frustration of our mortal coil: we can't learn more than one thing at a time. The road to understanding is narrow and there are no shortcuts. No one can reach an advanced level without first working through the intermediate and novice levels step by step. Everything you do here should be an oportunity to push you forward *exactly* one step--concept by concept, fact by fact. Now, the assignments cannot know exactly what step you're on; only you can know that. So, the labs and the lectures are going to contain a variety of concepts: some of which will be review and some will be material you're still learning.

Because the program is so immersive, its easy to feel like you need to be learning everything at the same time. You'll see a lab and there will be a few things that you feel shakey on. Remember, though, if you try to learn it all at the same time, you'll end up learning none of it. Instead, set a specific goal for each learning experience. Say to yourself: "I am going to use this lab to learn X." Once your goal is set you know where your attention needs to be--everything else is peripheral. Of course, at the end of the day the labs need to work, the tests needs to pass, the app needs to run. Only one aspect, though, needs to be perfect. Everything else can just be 'good enough,' but only 'for now.'

Ultimately the goal is to learn it all, so whenever you find yourself having to make something 'good enough' to pass a test, make a mental note. That concept can be the next goal on your list--you might even make that your goal for the next lab--just don't let it destract you from whatever you're focusing on for that one assignment.

### Be where you are, but keep moving forward

When you set these goals, watch out for you ambition. Make them small, reasonable, and appropriate to your skill level at that moment in time. If your at the Tarzan part of your journey, then set Tarzanian goals. You should always be working on something that challenges you *conceptually*, but doesn't overwhelm you. If your goals are too small, then your going to wander off the road and not progress forward, but if their too big, your going to panic and stop moving. You want to always be outside of your comfort zone, but never washed out to sea.

Remember also that the difference between the novice and advanced stages has nothing to do with facts or content and everthing to do with skills. You're goals should also always be to *do* something and never to *know* something. Someone who is intermediate at something can set a goal to learn a new method or API ever day--they could memorize everything about programming--and they would still stand there at the itermediate level. Instead, keep our stages of understanding in mind and work towards getting to the next stage.

Now, you will probably also find that your proficieny varies wildly between programming concepts. Maybe you're an expert at designing classes and objects, but then asyncronous fetches seem way over your head. Be where you are with whatever concept your focusing on. Every concept is a unique microjourney and every day you start fresh from square one, but if you can fall into the rhythm of conceptual learning, you'll start mastering new things faster and faster.
