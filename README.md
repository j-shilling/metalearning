# Metalearning

Let's think about what *learning* is: it's something that we, as human beings with human brains, are born doing from day one, but like all of our other natural abilities, if we reflect on the actual machanics of the process, we can start to do it in a more delibrate and efficient way. We might have a subconsious instinct that enables us to run, but no one is going to finish a marathon without reflecting on *how* we run and what we can do to run *better*. Learning is the same way--if we want to go from casuals to marathon-learners, we are going to need to teach ourselves how learning works. We are going to start by outlining exactly what our goals are, i.e. how we know when we're done, before we dive into to looking at some things to consider along the way.

## Understanding

If you ask someone what how you know when you've learned something, their going to answer, when you understand it. Really, though, this just reframes the question: what does it mean to understand something?
