# Metalearning

Let's think about what *learning* is: it's something that we, as human beings with human brains, are born doing from day one, but like all of our other natural abilities, if we reflect on the actual machanics of the process, we can start to do it in a more delibrate and efficient way. We might have a subconsious instinct that enables us to run, but no one is going to finish a marathon without reflecting on *how* we run and what we can do to run *better*. Learning is the same way--if we want to go from casuals to marathon-learners, we are going to need to teach ourselves how learning works. We are going to start by outlining exactly what our goals are, i.e. how we know when we're done, before we dive into to looking at some things to consider along the way.

## Stages of Understanding

If you ask someone "how do you know when you've learned something," their going to answer, "when you understand it." Really, though, this just reframes the question: what does it mean to understand something? One specfic gauge of understanding is to think about whether you could participate in a conversation about it: if you were interacting with a an expert could you keep up? could you answer questions? could you contribute actively?

Imagine for a minute that you have been invited to a programming party--where everyone is going to stand surrounded by all the programming concepts in the world and talk about them. At the party your going to see a few guests:

1. **Tarzan** is not a great conversationalist. He's just started to learn how to program and hasn't writen anything yet. He is able listen to conversations and get the gist of what they're about, but not pull any specifc knowledge from them. When he looks over all the concepts he's able to point at them and grunt out a name here and there: ...variable...array...method...

2. **Dora the Explorer** is also at the party. She's been programming for a little bit, but still lakes a conceptual foundation for a lot of what she does. In the conversations at the party she's about to ask and answer factual questions about programming concepts, but cannot talk about them at length. ...is this a global variable? yes / no... ...is this a class or instance method? class / instance...

3. **The New Kid** is hanging out at the party. They've written there own programs and undertand what and why they use certain concepts. They can answer open ended questions about programming concepts and understand why things work the way they do. ...why would you use a class variable here?... ...Let me explain the difference between arr.each and arr.map...

4. **The Expert** is throwing the party. They've written many of there own programs and can talk at length about a wide variety of concepts. At first they may seem a lot like The New Kid, but, when they talk about a concept, they can also talk about its connections with other ideas and they can discuss how that topic would play out in unusual situations. ...what if you tried to write following a proceedural paradigm?...

Its important to keep in mind that these guests are going to have trouble talking to each other--but not because of a different in factual knowledge. Tarzan understand all the *words* the expert uses. He may know what "array" and "list" *mean*. But when he hears, "arrays represent continuous segments of memory and lists can be discontinous," he's going to derrive no meaning from that sentence as a whole--not because he needs to be told *what* any of those things are, but because he still needs to internalize the underlying concepts. At the same time, Tarzan may know a lot of facts a words that the Expert has forgotten. The Expert may not actually be able to rattle off a definition of a bubble sort, but that's just because the concept is so internalized that they don't need the label anymore--its just a second nature thing that he does.

Every one of us is in some ways the Tarzan and in some ways the Expert. We all have ideas that we've heard of but can't define and we all have concepts that are so familiar we can see connections to them everywhere. Even in very similar things, our proficiency level can vary widely, but if we can self assess where we are at, we can then target our learning to get us to the next step in the journey to mastery. If I understand that I'm a Tarzan now, I can set practical and reachable goal for myself. I know that I'm not going to turn into an Expert tomorrow, but I can try to turn into Dora.

These guests also have technical names from ACFL:
1. **Novice**: Can recognize the basic vocabulary of a topic.
2. **Intermediate**: Can answer factual questions about a topic.
3. **Advanced**: Can describe something in a topic.
4. **Superior**: Can contribute to a topc.

### Be where you are
### Stay between the lines
### Close enough is good enough, for now
